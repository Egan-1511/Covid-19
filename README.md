# 🦠 COVID-19 Detection Using CT Scan Images

## 📌 Problem Statement
Accurate and early detection of COVID-19 from CT scans is crucial in helping medical professionals. This project uses deep learning to classify CT scan images as COVID-positive or negative.

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a CNN model to classify CT scan images.
- Achieve high accuracy using image preprocessing and deep learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- React.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Flask(API)

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Used publicly available CT scan datasets.
2. **Preprocessing:** Resized images, normalized pixel values.
3. **Model:** Built a CNN model with multiple convolution and pooling layers.
4. **Training:** Trained with augmentation, validated on a test set.
5. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

## ✅ Results
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on test data.
- Model detects COVID-19 from CT scans effectively.
- Visual explanation using Grad-CAM (optional, if added).
